# hue-vrcontrollers (WIP)
Control your hue lights with vive/oculus controllers.
You won't need your headset while setup/controlling, only your tracked hand controllers.

## HowTo
**WIP**
- choose your bridge or enter bridge ip if automatic bridge discovery fails

- click lights to configure in last, then grab your vive/oculus controller, go to the light you want to configure and draw a circle with holding the trigger, then release. The light should flash up if succesfu

- repeat for remaining lamps in your (VR tracked) room

- when finished setting up lamps, go back to the screen and review the positions. you can start toggling lights with the trigger or changing colors with the trackpad/thumpad. Enjoy!
