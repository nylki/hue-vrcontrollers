# hue-vrcontrollers
Control your hue lights with vive/oculus controllers.
You won't need your headset while setup/controlling, only your tracked hand controllers.

## HowTo

- choose your bridge or enter bridge ip if automatic bridge discovery fails

- grab your vive/oculus controller, go to the first light you want to configure and pull the trigger, while touching the lamp as close as possible

- repeat for remaining lamps in your (VR tracked) room

- when finished setting up lamps, go back to the screen and review the positions, then switch from `setup` to `control` mode
